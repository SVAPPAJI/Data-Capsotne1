By using this project people can select the best neighborhood out of the neighborhoods.\n\nIn world people are travelling one place to another place for the purpose of jobs or trips. So, they need to choose the best place based on their neighbor hoods like restaurants, hotels, bakery and malls etc. In this project, people are migrating to Canada from various countries due to the business or job purposes. The migrant people need to put the more effort to find the best price for rental basis or buy an house with all available facilities like resultants, hospitals, Supermarkets, malls and schools near to the houses.\n\nThis Project gives analysis of features for a migrant people to Scarborough search a best neighborhood as a comparison between the neighborhoods based on the analysis.\n\nThis project will give a better decision and awareness of the new place like city, state, country or place of work to migrant people. This wills leads his life will start in better way in a new place.\n"

The data frame consist of Postal code, Borough and Neighborhood.\n\nFoursquare API Data:\n\nTo get the different venues at the specified location or neighborhoods we need the Foursquare API data in order to get the venues. So, by using foursquare location information we can get the all manner of Venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. Therefore we will use the Foursquare API. It will be helpful to get the stated information.\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n\nThe venues information can be retrieved from the Foursquare based on the longitude and latitude of the postal codes within a specified distance range. \nThe information can be retrieves per venue as follows.\n\n1.\tNeighborhood\n2.\tLongitude of the Neighborhood\n3.\tLatitude of the Neighborhood\n4.\tVenue\n5.\tVenue Name e.g the name of the hotel or hospital etc..\n6.\tLongitude of the venue\n7.\tLatitude e of the Venue\n8.\tCategory of the Venue\n"
