So, by using foursquare location information we can get the all manner of Venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. Therefore we will use the Foursquare API. It will be helpful to get the stated information.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n\nThe venues information can be retrieved from the Foursquare based on the longitude and latitude of the postal codes within a specified distance range. \n"
